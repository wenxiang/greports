# **Fundamental Analysis and Investment Thesis for Link Real Estate Investment Trust (0823.HK)**

## **Part 1: Executive Summary & Final Recommendation**

### **Investment Thesis**

Link REIT (0823.HK) presents a compelling investment opportunity, rooted in a significant valuation disconnect between its current market price and its intrinsic fundamental strength. The market appears to be overly penalizing the REIT for broad macroeconomic headwinds in Hong Kong and Mainland China, while failing to appreciate the proven resilience of its non-discretionary retail portfolio, the tangible benefits of its successful diversification strategy, and its fortress-like balance sheet. As Asia's largest and only internally-managed REIT, its superior governance structure and best-in-class management team provide a durable competitive advantage, positioning it to navigate the current cycle and deliver sustainable, long-term growth in distributions and capital value for unitholders.

### **Quantitative Buy Rating**

**8.5 / 10 (Strong Buy)**

This rating reflects a high-conviction view based on the REIT's significant discount to its net asset value, a robust and defensive operational profile, a pristine balance sheet that insulates it from interest rate shocks, and a clear, executable strategy for future growth through diversification and its "REIT Plus" model.

### **Target Entry Price**

**12-Month Target Entry Price: HK$52.50**

### **Key Risks & Mitigating Factors**

1. **Prolonged Economic Weakness in Hong Kong and Mainland China:** A deeper or more extended-than-anticipated recession in its core markets could pressure rental income and property valuations more severely than forecast.  
   * **Mitigating Factors:** The portfolio's high concentration of non-discretionary retail (supermarkets, F\&B) provides defensive cash flows.1 Furthermore, the growing contribution from its international assets in Singapore and Australia provides a crucial geographical hedge against regional weakness.2  
2. **Intensifying Outbound Consumption from Hong Kong:** An acceleration of the trend where Hong Kong residents travel to Mainland China for consumption could further dampen tenant sales and rental reversion prospects in the Hong Kong retail portfolio.  
   * **Mitigating Factors:** Link's active asset management, including over 100 asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs), has enabled its portfolio to consistently outperform the broader Hong Kong retail market, demonstrating an ability to maintain footfall and tenant sales even in a challenging environment.2  
3. **Sharp, Unexpected Rise in Global Interest Rates:** Although well-hedged, a sudden and significant spike in global interest rates could increase refinancing costs more than anticipated and lead to further cap rate expansion, negatively impacting property valuations and the NAV.  
   * **Mitigating Factors:** Link REIT maintains a very low gearing ratio of 21.5% and has 66.9% of its debt portfolio at fixed interest rates, providing a substantial buffer against rate volatility.5 Its strong 'A' credit ratings ensure continued access to capital at favorable terms.7

## **Part 2: Deep-Dive Analysis**

### **Section A: Business and Portfolio Quality Analysis**

#### **The 'REIT Plus' Model: A Unique Competitive Advantage**

Link Real Estate Investment Trust (Link REIT) operates under a distinct and advantageous structure that sets it apart from its regional peers. It is Asia's only internally-managed REIT, a critical feature that aligns the interests of the management team directly with those of its unitholders.4 Unlike the prevalent externally-managed model in Asia, where a separate management company (often related to a property developer sponsor) collects fees from the REIT, Link's internal structure eliminates this layer of potential conflict and fee leakage. This ensures that operational efficiencies and cost savings translate directly into higher distributable income for investors.

Furthermore, the REIT is 100% free-float, with ownership distributed among public and institutional investors, fostering a governance environment focused purely on maximizing unitholder value.4 This structure has been a cornerstone of its ability to deliver a 9.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in its total distributable amount since its listing in 2005\.5

The REIT's forward-looking "Link 3.0" strategy builds upon this strong foundation. This strategy has two primary pillars: first, the continued diversification and optimization of the property portfolio with a focus on the Asia-Pacific region; and second, the expansion of its real estate investment management (REIM) capabilities.2 The goal is to evolve into a "REIT Plus" entity that not only generates stable rental income but also creates new revenue streams from asset and fund management services, leveraging its deep operational expertise to partner with other capital sources.4 This strategic evolution is designed to enhance resilience across different economic cycles and accelerate growth beyond what could be achieved through its balance sheet alone.

#### **Portfolio Overview: A Diversified and Resilient Asset Base**

Link REIT's portfolio, valued at approximately HK$226 billion as of March 2025, is a well-diversified collection of high-quality assets across multiple sectors and geographies.7 This diversification is a direct result of the "Link 3.0" strategy, which has deliberately reduced the REIT's historical concentration in Hong Kong retail.

* **Primary Sectors:** The portfolio encompasses a mix of defensive and growth-oriented sectors. The core consists of community-focused, non-discretionary Retail properties, complemented by stable Car Parks, and growth-oriented Office and Logistics assets.5 This blend provides a resilient income base from its necessity-based retail while capturing upside from sectors benefiting from structural tailwinds like e-commerce (logistics).  
* **Geographical Exposure:** The strategic pivot towards geographic diversification is evident in the portfolio's composition by value. As of March 2025, Hong Kong constitutes 75.1% of the portfolio, a significant reduction from its early days. Mainland China accounts for 13.9%, while the international portfolio (comprising assets in Australia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) now represents 11.0%.10 This expansion into other developed APAC markets is a key de-risking and growth initiative.  
* **Asset Quality:** The quality of the underlying real estate is high. The foundational Hong Kong retail assets are predominantly suburban malls anchored by supermarkets and other non-discretionary tenants, making them integral parts of the communities they serve.10 The international portfolio includes prime, Grade-A assets such as 100 Market Street in Sydney and Jurong Point in Singapore, which are dominant in their respective trade areas.2 The logistics portfolio is modern and strategically positioned near key transportation hubs in China's most economically vibrant regions, the Greater Bay Area and the Yangtze River Delta.2

The following table provides a clear breakdown of the portfolio's composition, illustrating the successful execution of its diversification strategy.

| Geography | Asset Sector | Portfolio Value (HK$M) | % of Total Portfolio |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Hong Kong** | Retail, Car Parks, Office | 169,576 | 75.1% |  |
| **Mainland China** | Retail, Office, Logistics | 31,386 | 13.9% |  |
| **International** | Retail, Office | 24,838 | 11.0% |  |
| **Total** |  | **225,800** | **100.0%** |  |
| Source: Link REIT Annual Report 2024/2025 5 |  |  |  |  |

The divergent performance across these geographies underscores the value of this strategy. While the Hong Kong retail market faced challenges in FY2024/25, recording a negative rental reversion of \-2.2% due to a weak local economy and changing consumer habits, the international and Mainland China portfolios acted as a powerful buffer.2 The Mainland China portfolio (excluding one asset undergoing repositioning) achieved a strong positive rental reversion of \+7.6%, while the newly acquired Singapore assets reported an exceptional reversion of 18.9% in the first half of the fiscal year.2 This demonstrates that the diversification is not merely a strategic concept but a tangible and effective hedge that is actively stabilizing the REIT's overall income in a challenging environment.

#### **Tenant Profile & Lease Structure: Defensive and Stable**

Link REIT's operational stability is anchored by a well-diversified, high-quality tenant base and a prudently managed lease profile.

* **Tenant Diversification:** The REIT exhibits very low tenant concentration risk. While the FY24/25 report did not list the top tenants, the prior year's report showed that the five largest customers accounted for just 13.7% of total revenue, with the single largest tenant contributing only 5.1%.12 This granular diversification insulates the REIT from the potential failure or departure of any single tenant.  
* **Industry Diversification (Trade Mix):** The portfolio's strength lies in its defensive tenant mix, which is heavily skewed towards non-discretionary spending. In its core Hong Kong retail segment, Food & Beverage (29.0%) and Supermarkets/Foodstuff (20.8%) are the two largest categories by monthly rent.1 This focus on daily necessities ensures a consistent and reliable stream of rental income that is less vulnerable to economic downturns compared to REITs focused on luxury or discretionary retail. This defensive positioning is a key reason why Link REIT's tenant sales decline of 3.0% in FY24/25 significantly outperformed the broader Hong Kong market's decline of 7.0%.2  
* **Lease Stability and Occupancy:** The REIT maintains exceptionally high occupancy rates across its portfolio, a testament to the desirability of its assets and its proactive management. As of March 2025, occupancy for Hong Kong Retail was 97.8%, Mainland China Retail was 95.9%, and Mainland China Logistics was 97.4%.5 These metrics have been consistently high over many years, indicating a durable competitive advantage. While a portfolio-wide Weighted Average Lease Expiry (WALE) is not disclosed, the lease expiry profile is well-staggered, with no single year facing an excessive volume of renewals, which mitigates leasing risk.1 The international office portfolio boasts a healthy WALE of approximately 4.7 years, providing long-term income visibility.9

This operational excellence creates a defensive moat. The ability to maintain near-full occupancy and outperform the market on tenant sales during a downturn is not a matter of luck. It is the direct outcome of a deliberate strategy focused on necessity-based retail, coupled with a proven track record of over 100 asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) that continually refresh and improve the assets to meet evolving consumer needs.2 This operational superiority is a core qualitative strength that underpins the investment thesis.

#### **Recent Portfolio Activity: Strategic Capital Recycling**

Link REIT's management team has demonstrated a disciplined and value-accretive approach to capital allocation through active portfolio management.

* **Acquisitions:** Recent acquisitions have been strategically aligned with the "Link 3.0" strategy. The move to take full control of Link Plaza Qibao in Shanghai in February 2024 deepened its presence in a key Tier 1 city in China and was a direct contributor to revenue growth in the Mainland segment.2 Continued investment in modern logistics assets in the Yangtze River Delta further builds out its exposure to the "New Economy" sector.9 These actions are clear, logical steps in executing its stated strategy of diversifying its income streams.  
* **Dispositions:** While no major assets were sold in the last fiscal year, the management team has a strong track record of capital recycling, having successfully divested over US$6 billion in non-core assets over the past five years.9 This disciplined approach involves selling mature or non-strategic properties at attractive valuations and redeploying the proceeds into higher-growth assets and geographies, a key driver of long-term value creation.7 This continuous optimization of the portfolio is a hallmark of a sophisticated and proactive asset manager.

### **Section B: Financial Health & Distribution Analysis**

#### **Income Statement Analysis: A History of Resilient Growth**

An examination of Link REIT's income statement over the past five years reveals a consistent and resilient growth trajectory, even through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent macroeconomic headwinds. Key performance indicators such as Gross Revenue, Net Property Income (NPI), and Total Distributable Amount have demonstrated the stability and quality of the REIT's earnings power. Since its IPO in 2005, the REIT has achieved a remarkable 9.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in its Total Distributable Amount, a testament to its long-term value creation for unitholders.5

In the most recent fiscal year ending 31 March 2025 (FY24/25), Link REIT continued this trend of solid performance. Gross Revenue increased by 4.8% year-on-year to HK14,223million,whileNetPropertyIncome(NPI)grewbyanevenstronger5.510,619 million.2 This NPI growth, outpacing revenue growth, points to effective cost management and operational efficiency. The Total Distributable Amount for unitholders rose by 4.6% to HK$7,025 million.7

The NPI Margin, a key indicator of profitability and operational efficiency for a REIT, stands at a very healthy 74.7% for FY24/25 (calculated as HK10,619MNPI/HK14,223M Revenue). The historical data presented in the table below shows that this margin has been consistently robust, reflecting the management's ability to control property-level operating expenses effectively.

The following table summarizes the REIT's key financial performance metrics over the last five fiscal years, illustrating its steady growth path.

| Fiscal Year (Ended 31 Mar) | Gross Revenue (HK$M) | NPI (HK$M) | NPI Margin (%) | Total Distributable Amount (HK$M) | DPU (HK cents) |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2021** | 10,744 | 8,238 | 76.7% | 6,010 | 289.99 |  |
| **2022** | 11,602 | 8,776 | 75.6% | 6,419 | 305.67 |  |
| **2023** | 12,234 | 9,198 | 75.2% | 6,311 | 274.31 |  |
| **2024** | 13,578 | 10,070 | 74.2% | 6,718 | 262.65 |  |
| **2025** | 14,223 | 10,619 | 74.7% | 7,025 | 272.34 |  |
| Source: Link REIT Financial Highlights 13, Annual Reports 14 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The dip in DPU in 2023 and 2024 is primarily attributable to an enlarged unit base following a rights issue in March 2023, rather than a decline in operational performance.17 The distributable amount continued to grow, and the DPU has already resumed its upward trajectory in FY2025.

#### **Balance Sheet Analysis: A Fortress of Financial Prudence**

Link REIT's balance sheet is exceptionally strong and managed with a high degree of prudence, providing it with significant financial flexibility and resilience in the face of market volatility.

* **Gearing Ratio / Leverage:** As of 31 March 2025, the net gearing ratio was a very conservative 21.5%.5 This is substantially below the 50% regulatory ceiling for Hong Kong-listed REITs and is also low compared to many of its international peers. This low level of leverage provides a massive cushion to absorb potential declines in property valuations without breaching debt covenants and gives the REIT substantial debt capacity to fund future acquisitions accretively.  
* **Debt Profile:** The management of the debt portfolio is a key strength.  
  * **Cost of Debt:** In a period of globally rising interest rates, Link REIT impressively managed to *reduce* its average all-in cost of debt to 3.6% in FY24/25, down from 3.8% in the previous year.2 This achievement highlights a sophisticated and proactive treasury function.  
  * **Fixed vs. Floating Rate Debt:** As of March 2025, 66.9% of the REIT's debt was on fixed interest rates.6 This high fixed-rate portion provides significant protection against rising interest rates, ensuring stability in finance costs and, consequently, in distributable income. The management team actively adjusts this mix based on their outlook for interest rates, demonstrating strategic financial management.9  
  * **Debt Maturity Profile:** The debt maturity schedule is well-staggered, with an average term to maturity of 2.9 years.9 There are no significant "towers" of debt maturing in any single year, which smooths out refinancing risk and prevents the REIT from being forced to refinance a large portion of its debt during unfavorable market conditions.  
* **Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR):** The REIT's ability to service its debt is robust. The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is a very strong 5.0x as of March 2025\.5 This means that its operating earnings are five times greater than its interest expenses, indicating a very low risk of financial distress and underscoring the safety of its balance sheet.

The proactive nature of Link's capital management is a source of value that is often overlooked. While many peers were caught off guard by the rapid rise in interest rates, Link's treasury team had already locked in low, fixed rates on a majority of its debt. This was achieved through timely refinancing and the strategic use of instruments like sustainability-linked loans and green bonds.7 This financial discipline is not a passive outcome but an active strategy that directly protects unitholder distributions from macro volatility, making Link a comparatively safer investment in the current environment.

#### **Distribution (Dividend) Analysis: Sustainable and Attractive Yield**

For income-oriented investors, Link REIT's distribution profile is a cornerstone of its investment appeal, characterized by sustainability, a clear policy, and an attractive yield.

* **Distribution Per Unit (DPU):** The DPU has demonstrated a commendable record of stability and growth. For FY24/25, the DPU grew by 3.7% to 272.34 HK cents.2 As seen in the 5-year financial table, the DPU has remained resilient through various economic cycles. The slight dip in FY23 and FY24 was a direct result of the enlarged unit base from the 2023 rights issue, which was a strategic move to fortify the balance sheet and fund growth, not a sign of operational weakness.17 The rebound in DPU in FY25 signals a return to a growth trajectory.  
* **Payout Ratio:** Link REIT adheres to a clear and unitholder-friendly distribution policy. It consistently distributes 100% of its total distributable income to unitholders.9 This policy is sustainable because "distributable income" for a REIT is a cash flow metric, calculated after adjusting for non-cash items like fair value changes in properties. This ensures that distributions are paid out of actual cash generated from operations, not from paper profits.  
* **Current Dividend Yield:** Based on the FY24/25 DPU of HK2.7234andtheclosingpriceon24June2025ofHK42.90, the forward dividend yield is approximately 6.35%. This represents a highly attractive income return, especially when compared to the risk-free rate and the yields offered by many other large-cap, blue-chip equities. This substantial yield provides investors with a significant portion of their total return in the form of cash distributions, while also offering the potential for capital appreciation.

### **Section C: Management, Governance, and Sponsor Analysis**

#### **Management Team: Experienced and Proven Leadership**

The quality and experience of a REIT's management team are paramount to its long-term success. Link REIT is led by a deeply experienced and highly regarded senior leadership team with a proven track record of value creation.

Group Chief Executive Officer George Hongchoy has been at the helm since May 2010, providing over a decade of stable and visionary leadership.20 His extensive career spans financial consulting, investment banking at firms like JP Morgan, and real estate investment.21 Mr. Hongchoy holds a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Canterbury and an MBA from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.22 His leadership has been internationally recognized; he was named one of the "100 Best-Performing CEOs in the World" by the Harvard Business Review in 2019, a rare accolade that underscores his caliber.21 Under his tenure, Link REIT has transformed from a domestic Hong Kong entity into the largest REIT in Asia, with a portfolio that has grown from HK

40billiontooverHK200 billion.20

The investment function is equally robust. It is co-led by Group Chief Investment Officer John Saunders, who joined in March 2024 after serving as the Head of Asia Pacific Real Estate at BlackRock, and Chief Investment Officer (Asia) Christine Chan, who has extensive experience in direct real estate investment and fund management at firms including ARA Asset Management and Hutchison Whampoa.24 This combination of a seasoned CEO with a globally experienced investment team provides a high degree of confidence in the REIT's strategic direction and execution capabilities.

#### **Sponsor: The Power of Internal Management**

One of Link REIT's most significant competitive advantages is its corporate structure. It has no sponsor and is internally managed, a rarity in the Asian REIT landscape.4

This internal management model is fundamentally superior for unitholders for several key reasons:

1. **Alignment of Interests:** The management team members are employees of the REIT itself. Their primary and sole fiduciary duty is to the unitholders. Their compensation and career progression are directly tied to the performance of the REIT, creating a powerful alignment of interests. This contrasts with externally managed REITs, where the manager has its own shareholders and may face conflicts of interest.  
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The structure eliminates the layers of fees (base management fees, performance fees, acquisition/divestment fees) that are typically paid to an external manager. These savings flow directly to the bottom line, increasing the distributable income available to unitholders and resulting in higher NPI margins.  
3. **Elimination of Related-Party Conflicts:** In a sponsor-led model, there is always a risk that the sponsor could sell its own properties to the REIT at prices that benefit the sponsor more than the REIT's unitholders. Link's independent structure completely removes this risk, ensuring that all acquisitions are conducted at arm's length and are judged solely on their merit for the REIT's portfolio.

This superior governance framework is not merely a "soft" or qualitative factor; it is a tangible financial asset. It directly contributes to higher returns and lower risk for investors, justifying a valuation premium over its externally managed peers.

#### **Corporate Governance: Upholding the Highest Standards**

Link REIT's commitment to best-in-class corporate governance is evident in the structure and composition of its Board and committees.

The Board is led by an Independent Non-Executive Director, Duncan Owen, ensuring that leadership is independent from the day-to-day management.27 The principle of independence is further embedded throughout the board's structure, with a supermajority of 8 out of the 11 board members being Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs).28 This composition ensures robust oversight, independent judgment, and effective challenge of management proposals.

The Board is supported by a comprehensive set of committees, including the Audit and Risk Management Committee, Finance and Investment Committee, Nomination Committee, and Remuneration Committee.28 These committees are also chaired by and composed of a majority of INEDs, ensuring that critical functions like financial reporting, risk management, executive appointments, and remuneration are governed by independent perspectives.29 The REIT is also highly committed to transparency and provides timely and comprehensive information to unitholders and the investment community through a wide range of channels, including detailed financial reports, presentations, webcasts, and regular investor meetings.31 This robust governance framework provides a strong system of checks and balances and significantly enhances investor confidence.

### **Section D: Macro and Sectoral Environment**

#### **Interest Rate Sensitivity: Well-Insulated Against Volatility**

The current global macroeconomic environment, characterized by a "higher-for-longer" interest rate stance from major central banks, presents a dual threat to the real estate sector: rising financing costs and upward pressure on capitalization rates, which in turn compresses property valuations. However, Link REIT is exceptionally well-positioned to navigate this challenging environment.

Its primary defense is its fortress-like balance sheet. With a net gearing ratio of only 21.5%, the REIT operates with a very low level of debt, providing a substantial buffer against valuation declines.5 More importantly, with 66.9% of its debt portfolio locked into fixed interest rates, the REIT is largely insulated from the immediate impact of rising short-term rates like the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR).6 This proactive hedging strategy has allowed Link to maintain a low and stable average borrowing cost of 3.6%, protecting its distributable income from the erosion that more heavily indebted or floating-rate-exposed peers are facing.2

#### **Sectoral Outlook: A Tale of Two Markets**

Link REIT's diversified portfolio is exposed to sectors with varying outlooks, a dynamic that highlights the importance of its strategic pivot.

* **Headwinds in Traditional Markets (Hong Kong & China Retail/Office):** The REIT's traditional core markets face notable headwinds. The Hong Kong retail sector is grappling with structural changes in consumer behavior, including an increase in outbound travel by residents to nearby cities like Shenzhen for shopping, and a slower-than-expected recovery in spending by tourists.2 While May 2025 retail sales showed a modest 2.4% increase, the year-to-date trend remains negative.33 The Hong Kong office market is also experiencing weakness, with forecasts pointing to high vacancy rates and continued downward pressure on rents in 2025 due to a significant pipeline of new supply.35 Similarly, the Mainland China market is contending with a slowing economy, a protracted property market downturn, and subdued consumer confidence, which puts pressure on both retail and office fundamentals in key cities like Beijing and Shanghai.2  
* **Tailwinds in Growth Sectors (Logistics & International):** In stark contrast, the sectors and geographies targeted by the "Link 3.0" strategy are benefiting from strong structural tailwinds. The logistics sector in both Hong Kong and Mainland China continues to be driven by the inexorable growth of e-commerce and the corresponding demand for modern, well-located warehousing and distribution facilities.41 Link's strategic acquisitions in this space position it to capture this growth. Furthermore, its diversification into stable, developed markets like Singapore and Australia provides access to different economic cycles and growth drivers, as evidenced by the strong performance of its assets in these countries.2 This bifurcation in performance validates the management's foresight in diversifying away from its legacy assets.

#### **Geographic Economic Outlook: Moderate Growth Clouded by Risks**

The economic outlook for Link's primary operating regions suggests a period of moderate but challenging growth.

* **Hong Kong:** The consensus forecast for Hong Kong's GDP growth in 2025 is in the range of 1.9% to 3.0%.44 However, the outlook is clouded by significant downside risks, including persistent global trade tensions, the impact of high interest rates on domestic demand, and the structural shifts in consumption patterns.46  
* **Mainland China:** China's economic growth is projected to slow to a range of 4.0% to 4.7% in 2025\.38 The economy continues to be weighed down by the ongoing correction in the property sector, which has a significant impact on consumer confidence and investment. The risk of escalating trade tariffs with the US also poses a material threat to its export-oriented economy.38

The market appears to be applying a broad, negative discount to any asset with significant exposure to Hong Kong and China, driven by this challenging macro narrative. However, this approach fails to differentiate between companies and ignores the specific, resilient attributes of Link REIT. Its defensive, non-discretionary tenant base has proven its ability to outperform the general market.2 Its balance sheet is fortified against interest rate shocks.6 Its diversification strategy is already delivering growth from other regions.3 This disconnect—between the general negative sentiment and Link's specific fundamental strengths—is the core of the mispricing and presents a compelling investment opportunity.

## **Part 3: Valuation**

The valuation of Link REIT is conducted through a triangulation of methodologies, primarily a Comparable Company Analysis based on key REIT metrics and a Distribution Discount Model (DDM) to ascertain its intrinsic value. This approach provides a robust framework for establishing a fair value range and a 12-month target price.

### **Comparable Company Analysis (Comps)**

A peer group of large-cap, publicly listed REITs in the Asia-Pacific region with diversified or retail/logistics-focused portfolios has been selected for a relative valuation analysis. This peer group allows for a meaningful comparison of how the market is valuing Link REIT relative to its competitors. The key metrics for comparison are Price-to-Net Asset Value (P/NAV), which is crucial for asset-intensive businesses, and Dividend Yield, which is paramount for income-focused investors.

The analysis reveals that Link REIT is trading at a significant discount to its own Net Asset Value (NAV) per unit of HK$63.30 as of March 2025\.8 Furthermore, its valuation appears attractive when benchmarked against its peers, especially when considering its superior scale, 'A' grade credit rating, and best-in-class internal management structure, which would typically warrant a valuation premium.

| Company Name (Ticker) | Market Capitalization (USD) | Price / NAV | Dividend Yield (Fwd) | Price / FFO (TTM) |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Link REIT (0823.HK)** | **$14.1 B** | **0.52x** | **8.0%** | **11.9x** |  |
| CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (C38U.SI) | $12.5 B | 1.05x | 5.6% | 18.9x |  |
| Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (BUOU.SI) | $3.5 B | 0.85x | 6.5% | 14.5x |  |
| ESR-LOGOS REIT (J91U.SI) | $2.1 B | 0.90x | 8.4% | 14.9x |  |
| SF REIT (2191.HK) | $0.3 B | 0.53x | 11.0% | 9.1x |  |
| **Peer Average** |  | **0.83x** | **7.9%** | **14.4x** |  |
| **Peer Median** |  | **0.88x** | **7.5%** | **14.7x** |  |
| Note: Data as of late June 2025\. Market caps are approximate. Link REIT metrics based on HK42.90shareprice,HK63.30 NAV, HK$2.7234 DPU, and estimated FFO. Peer data compiled from various sources.50 P/NAV and P/FFO for peers are estimates based on available data. |  |  |  |  |  |

The comparable analysis clearly indicates that Link REIT is undervalued on a relative basis. Its P/NAV of 0.52x is substantially lower than the peer average of 0.83x. While its dividend yield is in line with the peer average, its P/FFO multiple is also at the lower end of the spectrum. Applying the peer average P/NAV multiple of 0.83x to Link REIT's NAV per unit of HK63.30wouldimplyafairvalueofapproximatelyHK52.50. This suggests a significant valuation gap.

### **Distribution Discount Model (DDM)**

Given Link REIT's mature status and its policy of distributing 100% of its distributable income, a two-stage Distribution Discount Model (DDM) is an appropriate methodology for estimating its intrinsic value.

**Assumptions:**

* **Stage 1: Explicit Forecast Period (5 Years)**  
  * **Base DPU (FY2025):** HK$2.7234.8  
  * **DPU Growth Rate (Years 1-5):** A conservative 2.5% annual growth rate is assumed. This reflects a blend of modest growth from the resilient Hong Kong portfolio (driven by AEIs and stable rents), offset by macro headwinds, but supported by stronger contributions from the growing international and logistics segments.  
* **Stage 2: Terminal Value**  
  * **Discount Rate (Cost of Equity, r):** Calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).  
    * Risk-Free Rate (Rf​): 3.5% (based on Hong Kong 10-year government bond yield).  
    * Beta (β): 0.9 (reflecting lower volatility than the broader Hang Seng Index).  
    * Equity Risk Premium (ERP): 6.0% (a standard assumption for the Hong Kong market).  
    * **Cost of Equity (r) \= 3.5% \+ 0.9 \* 6.0% \= 8.9%**  
  * **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** A perpetual growth rate of 1.5% is assumed, reflecting long-term inflation and the mature growth profile of the REIT.

**Calculation:**

The DDM calculation is as follows:

* DPU Projections:  
  * Year 1 (FY26): HK$2.791  
  * Year 2 (FY27): HK$2.861  
  * Year 3 (FY28): HK$2.933  
  * Year 4 (FY29): HK$3.006  
  * Year 5 (FY30): HK$3.081  
* Present Value of Stage 1 DPUs: Sum of discounted DPUs for years 1-5 \= HK$11.68  
* Terminal Value (at end of Year 5): DPU6​/(r−g)=(3.081∗1.015)/(0.089−0.015)=HK42.36  
* Present Value of Terminal Value: 42.36/(1+0.089)5=HK27.59  
* **Intrinsic Value per Unit \= PV of Stage 1 DPUs \+ PV of Terminal Value \= HK11.68+HK27.59 \= HK$39.27**

The DDM yields a more conservative intrinsic value of HK$39.27. This is likely due to the model's high sensitivity to the discount rate and terminal growth assumptions in the current high-rate environment. It reflects a valuation based purely on discounted future cash flows, without giving credit to the underlying asset value.

### **Valuation Synthesis & Target Price Recommendation**

The two primary valuation methods provide a range for Link REIT's fair value.

* **Comparable Company Analysis (P/NAV basis):** HK$52.50  
* **Distribution Discount Model (DDM):** HK$39.27

In a market environment where property valuations have been under pressure due to rising cap rates, the Net Asset Value (NAV) serves as a particularly strong and tangible anchor for valuation. The P/NAV multiple reflects how the market values the REIT's physical assets relative to its peers. The DDM, while theoretically sound, is highly sensitive to long-term assumptions that are difficult to predict with precision in the current volatile macroeconomic climate.

Therefore, a higher weighting is assigned to the NAV-based comparable analysis. A blended target price is calculated with a 70% weighting on the Comps-derived value and a 30% weighting on the DDM-derived value.

**Blended 12-Month Target Price \= (0.70 \* HK52.50)+(0.30∗HK39.27) \= HK36.75+HK11.78 \= HK$48.53**

Rounding to a practical level, this analysis supports a **12-month target price of HK$48.50**. However, given the exceptional quality of the REIT, its 'A' credit rating, superior governance, and the potential for a positive sentiment shift as interest rates eventually peak and decline, a modest premium is warranted. A reversion to a P/NAV multiple closer to 0.9x, slightly above the peer average, is highly plausible as market conditions normalize, which would imply a target closer to HK$57.00.

Considering these factors, a final **12-month target entry price of HK$52.50** is established. This price corresponds to the value derived from the peer average P/NAV multiple and represents a potential upside of approximately 22.4% from the current price of HK$42.90. This significant potential return, combined with a robust 6.35% dividend yield, underpins the "Strong Buy" recommendation.
